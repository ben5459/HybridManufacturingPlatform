# Wireless Automatic Toolchanger

![Tool Change GIF](https://github.com/ben5459/HybridManufacturingPlatform/blob/44d53604ea88ddc55a182922c3dc7c002d66ddbc/Automatic%20Tool%20Changer/Images/Toolchange%20GIF.gif)


## Highlights:
#### - Wireless - No cables or wires need to be connected to the X carriage. 
#### - Intelligence built in - Lock engaged/disengaged status and tool attached/detached status reporting.
#### - Designed for a heated environment - All components are rated for continuous use at 85C or higher.
#### - Reliable - Eliminates common components that can fail (steppers, servos, torque plates, etc)
#### - Convenient - Tools are stored at the front.
#### - True kinematic coupling- Design complies with the maxwell criteria.


## Use Cases:
#### Multi-Color	
#### Multi-Material
#### Speed Optimization 
#### Hybrid Process 
###### Additive + Subtractive

## Features:
- True kinematic coupling that complies with the maxwell criteria.
- Able to detect the current state of the lock mechanism. 
- Able to detect a fault in the locking mechanism (neither slider switch is triggered).
- Able to detect crashes that are not recoverable.
- Electrical connection between toolheads is rated for up to 1,000,000 cycles. 
- Compatible with two and three pin probes.

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>
<p>
 <br />
 

### What it isn't:
- Lighter than the stock Voron toolhead<br />
- Cheaper than the stock Voron toolhead	<br />
- Designed to mill anything that you can't extrude out of the attached hotends<br />
    
### What it is: <br />
- Compact<br />
- Lightweight<br />
- Extensible<br />
- Wireless<br />

## Frequently Asked Questions:
**Q:** SmCo magnets have a TwMax of 250-350C. Why are you using NdFeB magnets? <br /> 
**A:** Our custom NdFeB magnets have an energy density 30% higher than SmCo magnets while still offering a TwMax of 150C. <br />

Q: How does this compare to an Idex printer?<br />
A: This is more complex but it is also more flexible. Additionally, a tool changer can be faster because it isn't weighed down by the second printhead on an idex printer. <br />

Q: Which is better, the Enraged Rabit Carrot Feededer or this?<br />
A: They are complementary. Any one of the tools used on the tool changer can also have virtual tools that correspond with materials in the ERCF. <br />
