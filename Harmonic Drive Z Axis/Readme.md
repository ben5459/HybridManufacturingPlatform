A minute of arc, arcminute (arcmin) is a unit of angular measurement equal to 1/60 of one degree. 
One degree is 1/360 of a complete rotation, therefore, one arcmin is 1/21600 of a turn.

If a pulley has a pitch diameter of 34.38mm (36 tooth GT3 Pulley), Then one arcmin would be equal to 0.00159166666666666666666666666667mm

2 arc min = 1/10800 or .000092592592592592592592592592592593 of a turn would be equal to 0.003183mm
