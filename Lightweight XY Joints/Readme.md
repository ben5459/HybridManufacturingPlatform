## Features:
- Aluminum with black anodize finish
- Two piece interlocking design 
- Design uses precision shafts (g6 tolerance: -0.012ï½ž-0.004) for the pulley and bearings (Misumi SRMBR5-23)	

## Pros: 
- Increased stiffness [^1]
- Reduced thermal expansion [^1] 
- Lower profile 
- Reduced chance of belt abrasion against the idler bearings
- Zero travel lost when used with the Voron ATC

## Cons: 
- 7% increase in weight [^2][^3][^4]
- Cost

[^2]: Weight Calculations: 2.4r2 Stock XY Joints with hardware weight: 254.659g. Adjust for printed density of 60%; Left: 61.084g * 0.4 = 24.4336g, Right: 60.061g * 0.4 = 24.0244g, Total: 48.458g. Adjusted weight: 254.659g-48.458g=206.201g. Lightweight aluminum model weight(v0.03): 221.387g. Difference: 15.186g -> that's a 7.36% increase in weight.

[^3]: Using titanium fasteners further reduces the weight to 208.265g. The difference between the stock model then becomes 2.064g, which is a 1.00% increase in weight.

[^4]: Disclaimer: The threads on the stock model are solid but the threads on the lightweight aluminum model are modeled. This will introduce a small error into the calculation.
