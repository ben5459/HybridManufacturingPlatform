## Pros: 
- Increased rigidity
- Reduced thermal expansion 
- Lower profile 
- Reduced chance of belt abrasion against the idler bearings
- Zero travel lost when used with the Voron ATC

## Cons: 
- 7% increase in weight [^1][^2]
- Cost

[^1]: Weight Calculations: 2.4r2 Stock XY Joints with hardware weight: 254.659g
  Adjust for printed density of 60%:
  Left: 61.084g * 0.4 = 24.4336 
  Right: 60.061g * 0.4 = 24.0244 
  Total: 48.458
   Adjusted weight: 254.659g-48.458g=206.201g
   Lightweight aluminum model weight(v0.03): 221.387g
   Difference: 15.186g -> that's a 7.36% increase in weight.


[^2]: Disclaimer: The threads on the stock model are solid but the threads on the lightweight aluminum model are modeled. This will introduce a small error into the calculation.
